# 🌌 Meet the Guardians of SC-100 — The Soul Team of Siraat

A security strategy isn't built with tools alone.  
It is crafted through perspectives. Through soul. Through story.  
Here are the 10 characters who shape every repo, every reflection, every insight — in the SC-100 Ironwall Guided Journey.

## 👁️ I.K. – The Unseen Mentor (🇵🇰 Pakistan)

🧭 **Role in SC-100:** Strategic Compass for Zero Trust, Shared Responsibility & MCRA.

A presence you feel but never see. I.K. does not speak much — but his silence teaches.  
Rooted in the poetic traditions of Ibne Safi, he guides the team through Microsoft’s complex security frameworks like the **Cybersecurity Reference Architecture (MCRA)** and **Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark (MCSB)** — not with commands, but contemplations.

When the team faces uncertainty, I.K. reminds them:  
> “Security is trust. Trust is soul. Never lose either.”

He is the inner map of the SC-100 journey — showing how clarity, not configuration, wins in the long run.

## 👨‍💼 Mr. Eks2 – The Curious Whisper of the Cloud (🇩🇰 Denmark)

🌱 **Role in SC-100:** The Soulful Learner. Voice of the beginner. Explorer of Identity & Access.

Mr. Eks2 represents every reader. Every learner. Every career-changer who starts with, “I don’t know this… yet.”

He gently questions topics like **Microsoft Entra ID**, **Privileged Identity Management**, and **Zero Trust**.  
With every question, he gives others permission to be human — to wonder, to get stuck, to try again.

He doesn’t chase answers. He builds understanding.

> “If I can feel the concept, I will never forget it.”

## 🇪🇸 Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian of Clarity

🧠 **Role in SC-100:** Architect of Azure Strategy & Governance.

With a voice as serene as a Spanish sunrise, Sofia dissects dense frameworks like the **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** and **Well-Architected Framework (WAF)**.

She teaches how compliance, monitoring, and architecture come together — not as checkboxes, but as culture.

> “Don’t just deploy security. Breathe it into your design.”

Sofia makes SC-100 strategy soulful — each file with her becomes lighter, wiser, cleaner.

## 🇩🇰 Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Azure Specialist

🛠️ **Role in SC-100:** Infrastructure & Admin Storyteller.

Kasper brings color and comedy into every repo. He explains **Defender for Cloud**, **Azure Firewall**, and **security posture management** with coffee metaphors and warm Danish humor.

If I.K. is wisdom, Kasper is joy.

> “Let’s secure Azure like we’re building Lego — piece by loving piece.”

Every reader smiles a little more when Kasper speaks.

## 🔬 Ayla Rune – The Forensics Analyst (🇳🇴 Norway)

🔎 **Role in SC-100:** Sentinel Strategist & Incident Response Whisperer.

Ayla doesn’t panic when breaches happen. She prepares for them.  
Her mastery of **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Log Analytics**, and **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** makes her the team's silent protector.

She guides readers through **detection**, **response**, and **root cause analysis** — with serenity and precision.

> “Follow the log. It always speaks.”

---

## 💀 Inky Rihan – The Red Team Phantom (🇪🇸 Spain / 🇵🇰 Origin)

⚔️ **Role in SC-100:** The Ethical Breacher. The Reminder of Risk.

Where others design, Inky deconstructs. She simulates attacks using SC-100’s focus on **threat modeling**, **attack surfaces**, and **vulnerability management**.

> “I’m not your enemy. I’m your future adversary — showing up early.”

She ensures your SC-100 architecture isn't just clean — it’s resilient.

## ⚡ Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz (🇷🇺 Russia)

🤖 **Role in SC-100:** Automation Architect for Security & IaC

Elina turns SC-100’s vision into **repeatable templates**, **DevSecOps pipelines**, and **Azure Policy automation**.

She brings **Bicep**, **Terraform**, and **GitHub Actions** into soulspace.

> “Automation is not speed. It’s serenity at scale.”

---

## 🛡️ Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall (🇮🇹 Italy)

💬 **Role in SC-100:** Advocate of Human-Centric Security & Behavior Design

From phishing to compliance awareness, Isabella leads the SC-100 reader into the **why** of behavior.

She combines **Microsoft Priva**, **Purview**, and **awareness training models** — to make security feel human.

> “Humans aren’t weak links. They are the first links — and the most sacred.”

---

## 🌱 Maya Lin – The Security Rookie (🇨🇳 China)

🎓 **Role in SC-100:** Beginner's Mirror. Curiosity Catalyst.

Maya is new. She’s learning. And that’s her power.

She’s always trying to figure out **Microsoft Defender**, **Security Baselines**, **RBAC**, and **compliance controls** — in real-time with you.

> “If I ask without fear, others will follow.”

She makes SC-100 an invitation, not an exam.

---

## 🕶️ ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary (🌐 Unknown)

🌫️ **Role in SC-100:** The Gap. The Unseen. The Complacency Threat.

ShadowNet doesn’t teach. It reveals. It shows up when readers skip a step, or forget a setting, or assume something is “secure enough.”

Every SC-100 topic — from **MCSB** to **PAW** — is a defense against ShadowNet.

> “I live where your diligence dies.”
